    "output": "I'm at a loss as to why this would be interesting. Ripple needs an oracle so that RLUSD can be used in lending protocols on Ethereum. Flare doesn't provide oracles to other networks yet. It's something that may come but there are much bigger opportunities to pursue first: FAssets and native staking for XRP and BTC to name but two."

    "output": "No one has any knowledge of the rules around this yet. Rest assured if there is an opportunity for us to make sure that our American community aren't penalised for holding Flare relative to other tokens we will take it."

    "output": "I understand that it looks like the market is going in the wrong direction but zoom out. Billions of dollars of value are assigned to things that often seem frivolous, such as art works, jewellery and fashion. There is no reason to think that the same human impulses that give these items value will not also be at play in a decentralized setting. Flare exists to allow people to build what they wish in the best way possible with maximum decentralization, whether that is perps on a hot meme coin, institutional finance or the future of AI. We are here for all of it."

But as a dev there are definitely scenarios where I'd want features of other L1s that the enshrined L1s do not offer. Whomever lands first with an Irresistible L1, epic marketing, easy onboarding, and a lost cost, easy-to-use, trust-less Oracle system - may just end up own a gigantic eco-system. The potential is huge. I can see devs flocking here ðŸ“ˆ",
